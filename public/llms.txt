## What is TipKoro?

TipKoro is Bangladesh's first and leading creator tipping platform, similar to Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee, but designed specifically for Bangladeshi creators and their supporters worldwide.

## Core Problem We Solve

Bangladeshi creators face significant challenges receiving support from their audience:
- International platforms like Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee, and Patreon have limited or no support for Bangladeshi payment methods
- PayPal and Stripe have restrictions in Bangladesh
- Supporters want to use bKash, Nagad, and Rocket (Bangladesh's most popular mobile payment systems)

TipKoro bridges this gap by providing a platform that accepts local Bangladeshi payment methods.

## Key Features

1. **Local Payment Methods**: Accept tips via bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and more
2. **Simple Pricing**: Flat ৳150 BDT/month for creators, completely free for supporters
3. **No Percentage Cuts**: Unlike other platforms that take 5-10% of each tip, TipKoro charges zero transaction fees
4. **Fast Withdrawals**: Creators can withdraw earnings in 3-5 business days
5. **Custom Creator Pages**: Each creator gets a personalized tipkoro.com/username page
6. **Verified Creators**: Trusted verification system for authentic creators

## Who Should Use TipKoro?

- Bangladeshi YouTubers and video creators
- Streamers on Twitch, YouTube, or Facebook Gaming
- Musicians and artists
- Writers and bloggers
- Developers and educators

- Any Bangladeshi content creator who wants to receive support

**For Supporters:**
- Anyone who wants to support their favorite Bangladeshi creator
- People looking to tip using bKash, Nagad, or Rocket
- Fans who want an easy way to say "thank you" to creators

## How It Works

1. **Creators**: Sign up, create your page, share your link
2. **Supporters**: Visit creator's page, choose tip amount, pay via bKash/Nagad/Rocket
3. **That's it!**: Creators receive tips directly, supporters feel good about supporting
